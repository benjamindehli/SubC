## User Interface

### Dynamics

Determines whether the velocity should affect the volume and distortion.

### Saturation

The saturation knob blends between the clean samples and the distorted samples.
The clean samples are recorded through a Roland PA-120 mixer. The distorted/saturated samples are additionally sent through a Hairball Audio FET/RACK (1176 compressor) and a transformer and diode saturator.
The stereo samples are the same as the mono samples, but sent through a TC Electronic SCF Stereo Chorus Flanger in vibrato mode. This gives a much wider sound, but less bottom end when summed to mono.

### Envelope

Shape your sound precisely with the Attack, Decay, Sustain, and Release parameters. Whether you desire a punchy, staccato tone or a smooth, lingering ambiance, the ADSR envelope allows you to tailor the dynamics to your liking.

## Equipment used

- Dreadbox Erebus v2
